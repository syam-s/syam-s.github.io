    <hr><br>
    <div class="pubd">
     <p align = "justify"> The combustion characteristics of ethanol/Jet A-1 fuel droplets having three different proportions
	 of ethanol (10%, 30%, and 50% by vol.) are investigated in the present study. The higher volatility differential between ethanol
	 and Jet A-1 and the nominal immiscibility of the fuels seem to result in combustion characteristics that are rather different 
	 from our previous work on butanol/Jet A-1 blends. Abrupt explosion was facilitated in fuel droplets comprising lower proportions
	 of ethanol (10%), possibly due to insufficient nucleation sites inside the droplet and the partially unmixed fuel mixture. For 
	 the fuel droplets containing higher proportions of ethanol (30% and 50%), micro-explosion occurred through homogeneous nucleation,
	 leading to the ejection of secondary droplets and a significant reduction in the overall droplet lifetime. The rate of bubble growth
	 is nearly similar in all the blends of ethanol; however, the evolution of ethanol vapor bubble is significantly faster than that of
	 a vapor bubble in the blends of butanol. The probability of disruptive behavior is considerably higher in ethanol/Jet A-1 blends 
	 than that of butanol/Jet A-1 blends. The Sauter mean diameter of the secondary droplets produced from micro-explosion is larger for
	 blends with a higher proportion of ethanol. The growth of vapor bubble was also witnessed in the secondary droplets, which lead to 
	 the further breakup (puffing/micro-explosion). </p> </div>

        <hr><br>
				<div class="pubd"> <p align = "justify">The atmospheric carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen oxides have 
				been increasing since the industrial revolution. The threat to the depletion of petroleum and its significant impact 
				on the environment leads us to the renewable energy sources. An alternative fuel to Jet A-1 should be compatible with 
				Jet A-1 and should also undergo efficient combustion process. In the present study, the combustion characteristics of 
				butyl butyrate, limonene, and their blends with Jet A-1 droplets were investigated. The droplet temperature profiles of
				the blends of butyl butyrate and limonene were observed to be nearly similar to Jet A-1. The regression rate measurements
				of the fuel droplets show that butyl butyrate and limonene have burn rates that are almost similar to Jet A-1. The temporal
				evolution of butyl butyrate droplets is divided into three stages, the volumetric expansion, unsteady regression, and steady
				regression. The sooting propensity of pure limonene and its blends with Jet A-1 was found to be significantly higher than pure
				Jet A-1. Whereas, a much lower sooting propensity was observed for pure butyl butyrate and its blends with Jet A-1. The sooting 
				propensity decreases in the order of pure limonene, L50, pure Jet A-1, BB50, and pure butyl butyrate. </div>

        <hr><br>
				<div class="pubd"> <p align = "justify">The secondary atomization caused by puffing and micro-explosion phenomena play 
				a significant role in enhancing atomization in the combustion chamber. The physical processes such as bubble nucleation
				and dynamics of bubble growth leading to puffing/micro-explosion are not well understood. Puffing and Micro-explosion 
				phenomena in the ethanol/Jet A-1 blends (E10, E30, and E50) have been studied for relatively larger diameter droplets. 
				Micro-explosions were found to reduce the total burning time of the droplet. The abrupt explosion phenomenon was noticed
				only in E10 blend, which was a dominant phenomenon in this particular blend. Micro-explosions were categorized as undisturbed
				micro-explosion and puffing induced micro-explosion. Undisturbed micro-explosion is considered as a special case where the 
				bubble growth leading to micro-explosion occurs without prior puffing. Puffing was observed to increase the growth of the 
				vapor bubble as well as the intensity of breakup. Puffing/micro-explosion phenomenon was characterized by the normalized 
				squared onset diameter (NOD). The onset of bubble growth was found to be the prerequisite of puffing and only in a few cases
				the onset of bubble nucleation lead directly to micro-explosion. NOD was observed to decrease with the increase in the 
				proportion of ethanol component. Temporal variation of bubble radius has been shown for all the ethanol/Jet A-1 blends. 
				The lower degree of superheating of the ethanol component leads to the puffing phenomenon whereas the higher degree of 
				superheating leads to the micro-explosion phenomenon. Puffing was observed to be the dominant source of droplet ejections. 
				The velocity of ejected droplets was found to increase with the increase in the ethanol proportion.</p> </div>

            <hr><br>
    				<div class="pubd"> <p align = "justify">The current trend in aviation field is the use of alternative fuels (biofuels) or 
					their blends with aviation kerosene, because of the fluctuations and increase in fuel price and also for reducing HC and 
					CO emissions. Fuel is supplied into the combustion chamber in the form of fine droplets. Droplet combustion experiments give
					deeper understanding about the burning behaviour, efficiency and other properties of fuels. The present study focuses on the
					blending of petrol (gasoline), diesel and kerosene with biofuels like ethanol, and butanol. Base fuels blended with 5%, 10%	
					and 20% by volume of ethanol and butanol is used in this study. The experimental result shows that butanol and ethanol blending 
					improved the burning characteristics of base fuels. Diesel and kerosene have shown improvement in burn rate, whereas the burn
					rate of petrol (gasoline) is reduced by blending. We also observed micro explosions during droplet burning, and their intensity
					increasing with blending ratios. These micro explosions are due to the volatility difference between the base fuel and the blend
					and they improve the burn rate of diesel and kerosene. The results also showed improvement in droplet temperature distribution
					with blending. </p> </div>

							<hr><br>
            				<div class="pubd"> <p align = "justify">Generating efficient blade profiles are the prerequisite
							for developing a high-performance compressor. Therefore, the goal of a blade design is to achieve the
							desired flow turning with minimum losses, within the constraint of the geometric orientation of the 
							blade row. With the blade shapes becoming more sophisticated, the development of blade shapes is spanned
							in three generations: the first generation is the Circular-Arc Profile, the second generation is the 
							Controlled Diffusion Airfoil (CDA), and the third generation is the optimized blades. In this present 
							investigation, a CDA profile has been selected and is parameterized with Bezier-PARSEC (BP) parameterization
							method. From the BP parameters, the design variables are selected for the optimization using Genetic 
							Algorithm (GA) as an optimization technique. The BP parameters include the aerodynamic and geometrical 
							parameters. The objective function defined in the GA is to minimize the total pressure loss in the 
							compressor cascade for a high subsonic inlet condition. The CFD software’s Gambit and Fluent are used 
							for simulation and total pressure loss is calculated in the cascade geometry. The coupling of BP 
							parameterization, GA, and CFD increase the convergence speed of the optimization. This investigation 
							results from an airfoil shape for the compressor cascade arrangement with optimum total pressure loss.
